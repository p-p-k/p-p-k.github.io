                <p class="single-project long-text">The brief for this one-week prototyping project suggested two
                    possible areas to
                    explore:
                    <i>the relation between screen size and reach of fingers</i>, and
                    <i>the demands of different interaction patterns on finger dexterity</i>.

                    Importantly, the assignment required using a widely available digital prototyping tool – one where
                    you drag and drop rather than write code, that is.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    With this in mind, I chose
                    to rework a familiar calculator app.</p>

                                without shifting the phone slightly in your hand. More so, if you have small hands.

                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Scrapping the buttons</h3>

                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Based on my own experience, and talking to friends and family, I made the assumption that the most
                    common interaction flow for the calculator is:

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><i>enter first number</i></li>
                    <li><i>choose operator</i></li>
                    <li><i>enter second number</i></li>
                    <li><i>hit “equals to”</i></li>
                </ol>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Only one person said they used the <span class="calc-button">%</span> button, and no one I talked to
                    used the <span class="calc-button">+/-</span> button, or accessed the advanced options by flipping
                    the phone to landscape mode. For calculations on the go, the essentials then seem to be:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>ten digits and a comma</li>
                    <li>five operators</li>
                    <li>“clear” and “all clear”</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    One solution, I thought, to avoid having 18 buttons on the screen, might be to scrap the buttons
                    altogether. A gesture-based interface could allow people to use a smaller part of the screen, while
                    still offering the same functions. The space freed up by removing the buttons could hold something
                    useful that is missing today – a view of numbers entered earlier.

                </p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    As part of research, a classmate and I tried out two existing calculator apps – <a
                        href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rechner-calculator/id508837827">Rechner</a>
                    and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sums-gesture-controlled-calculator/id562219615">Sums</a>
                    – that use gestures for entering operators,
                    while numbers are entered through regular on-screen buttons. We found swiping across the buttons an
                    awkward
                    experience, as there was a sense of conflict between the two modes of input.</p>

                            and button

                            clear all calculations, or flip it to negate the current number. Both apps offer a
                            guide to explain the gesture interaction.

                    Having
                    realised that most digital prototyping tools support a similarly narrow range of predetermined
                    interactions, I picked <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">one tool</a> that was free, and decided to
                    see how far
                    I could
                    go, attempting to prototype something outside of those conventions.

                <h3 class=" single-project subhead">Think aloud testing</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">I tested the digital prototype on two classmates, sitting
                    next
                    to them, and partly explaining
                    what to do. They were asked to use one hand only. Unprompted, they thought aloud while testing, and
                    we also talked immediately afterwards.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">I was curious:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>How easy is it to remember the gestures? Are they distinct enough?</li>
                    <li>Will people use the guide? Is it helpful?
                    </li>
                    <li>How is this to use with one hand only, compared to the regular calculator app?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    To be clear: testing the prototype didn’t tell me whether gesture interaction on the move was a good
                    idea; whether it would be easier, or less disruptive, in a situation where you only have one hand
                    free. I did, however, learn a few other things that made the exercise worthwhile.</p>
                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Takeaways</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>The importance of <i>showing people the way, when
                            introducing less conventional interaction</i>s. The guide was not enough, and that bare
                        interface meeting you at the start was not very approachable or instructive either. Maybe an
                        opening
                        animation would be helpful, showing things in place and in motion?</li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Mixing modes of input is likely to be confusing.</i> After experiencing the issues with the
                        two
                        existing apps, which combined gestural input with regular on-screen buttons, I’m not sure why I
                        thought it would be reasonable to enter operators through gestures and digits by tapping. Having
                        two
                        ways of input – one based on written language and the other on tap duration – proved difficult
                        to
                        understand for users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>A prototyping tool meant to do one thing can be used for another</i>, if you’re willing
                        to give it a try.
                    </li>
