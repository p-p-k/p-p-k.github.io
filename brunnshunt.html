                        Brunnshög is
                    a new part
                    of Lund, being built from scratch <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brunnsh%C3%B6g,+Lund/@55.726793,13.2268952,14z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4653965af9c6dfe1:0x409125e950129fec!8m2!3d55.7263156!4d13.2415014">on the northeastern side of the city</a>. With international
                    research facilities rising alongside housing, office and commercial space, <a href="https://www.lund.se/brunnshog/english/">40,000 people are thought
                    to live and work over the neighbourhood’s 225 hectares by 2030</a>.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">Our brief from Lund Municipality was quite loose:
                    to come up
                    with a concept and a prototype for an interactive experience relating to Brunnshög in some way.
                </p>
                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Process</h3>

                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    After visiting the site, and discussing possible directions, our group decided to concentrate on
                    potential residents – and children in particular, since their point of view seemed overlooked.</p>
                <div class="row image">
                    <div class="col-lg-12"><figure><img class="img-responsive" src="images/brunnshog-playground-02.jpg" alt="">
                        <figcaption class="caption">
                            When we visited Brunnshög, most of the area was an inaccessible building site, including the
                            playground. The woods, parks and meadows around the neighbourhood, on the other hand, were open, and already
                            in use by people.

                    </div>

                </div>

                

                
                    <p class="single-project long-text">With
                    no time for research, we were left to draw on our own childhood experiences of moving to a new
                    place. By the time I was 9, I had lived in six cities in three countries; another member of the
                    group had relocated from Southeast Asia to Sweden when she was 10.</p>
                    <p class="single-project long-text">Based on our stories, we
                    formulated a few assumptions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Moving place can be exciting for children, but it can also be disruptive.</li>
                    <li>Getting children to move around physically in the new area can make them feel more at home,
                        replacing disruption with engagement and a sense of ownership.</li>
                    <li>Less concerned with things that lie years ahead, children are focused on the here and now.
                    </li>
                    <li>Children aged 12 and up have their own mobile phones, which could be embraced – if we’d manage
                        to keep participants from being glued to their screens.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    The brief asked if the “physicality of the actual site” could play a role in the project. We
                    believed that it should, but also noted that – here and now – the green areas surrounding Brunnshög
                    presented more opportunities for exploration than the neighbourhood being built.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">To get children to
                    move around, we tried to come up with different ways that the phone’s sensors and
                    capabilities could be used to
                    interact with the physical environment. For reference, we looked at <a
                        href="https://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/skola/naturen-som-klassrum">the outdoor
                        exercises put up by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation</a>, the augmented reality
                    game Pokémon GO, and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive">the situationist practice of the <i>dérive</i></a>, a strategy
                    of exploring the landscape
                    which accentuates playfulness and “drifting”.

                    Making ideas tangible through storyboards and paper prototypes, we arrived at something in between a
                    quiz, an obstacle course, and a treasure hunt. By proposing open-ended challenges – with no “right”
                    or “wrong” or “undo” – we hoped to support a playful atmosphere, where spontaneity and accidents are
                    encouraged. </p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    We tested the digital prototype with two children, aged 10 and 12. Its limited functionality meant that one of us had to be present and explain what to do – a circumstance that could
                    possibly skew the results. Still, what we learned was helpful, giving both concrete
                    pointers (“they know how to use a compass”, “they don’t understand the exclamation mark on the
                    screen”), and a better understanding, in general, of how children think and behave in this context.
                </p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">It also made us even more aware of how valuable it would have been to get a grasp of what it means
                    to be 12 years old, <i>before</i> developing the concept. Designing for children was much trickier
                    than we had thought; starting out with some rudimentary research could have allowed us to base our work on insights, rather than assumptions.
                </p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Our video prototype was well received by representatives from Lund Municipality.
                    They appreciated the balance between the digital experience and the experience of place, and how we invited, in their words, “the making of new geographies”.
                </p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    During presentation, someone asked if the companion app was an attempt at creating a
                    kind of social network for children. That had not been our intention – nor had the companion app been
                    our main focus, really – but the question was grounded, and pointed to an issue
                    we had passed by.</p>
                    <p class="single-project long-text">When thinking of tracking and displaying the whereabouts of children running
                    around in the woods, we should have paid closer attention to matters of privacy and security, and
                    possible social implications – perhaps by letting the participants be more anonymous.
