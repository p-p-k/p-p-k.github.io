                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Background</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">This work was done for a course on playful interaction, where
                    each student had to pitch a concept for a game or a toy. Out of these, seven were chosen for
                    developing
                    into playable prototypes, and teams formed around each. Among the seven was my idea for a
                    collaborative
                    drawing tool.</p>
                <h3 class="single-project subhead">The idea</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">I was curious to see what would happen if three people had to
                    negotiate
                    drawing with one virtual pen. Each person would have a different physical device, and each would
                    control
                    a specific property of the pen. Using sensors, the devices were thought to pick up changes in
                    position,
                    light intensity, and air flow, respectively.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">The whole thing might
                    take place in a public or semi-public setting, with the visual output being displayed as a
                    projection on
                    the wall.
                </p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Would it lead to collaboration, coexistence or conflict? Could less conventional tools bring
                    about
                    unusual drawings?</p>

                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Process</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Within our team of four, we brainstormed how the initial idea might evolve, by focusing on
                    different aspects: drawing, social interplay, surprise, tangible and embodied interaction.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">There was
                    a
                    new round of pitches – one suggested drawing with facial expressions; another involved
                    workout equipment, envisioning drawing as a physical exercise.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">In the end, we decided to run with the
                    idea which had stayed closest to the
                    original, the main difference being that the tool formerly sensing light intensity was now to be
                    watching out
                    for the user shaking it instead.</p>
                <div class="row image">
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-3 col-sm-2"></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-8">

                            <figcaption class="caption">Animation presented in the second pitch.</figcaption>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-3 col-sm-2"></div>
                </div>
                <p class="single-project long-text">The following weeks were spent tinkering with
                    electronics, code, sound, and
                    tangible materials; bodystorming; testing and evaluating. Throughout, we were concerned with how a
                    sense of play could be affected by the coupling between action and response, and how
                    it related to the social interaction between the users.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">One of our first prototypes enabled changing the thickness of the
                    drawn line by turning the knob of a potentiometer. It was simple, but oddly satisfying, and we
                    happily let
                    it replace the tool that would require the user to blow into it. Air flow as input, while
                    potentially intriguing
                    from an interaction point of view, proved tricky to get right.</p>

                </div>
                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Playtesting</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">Apart from informal, day-to-day testing, we also carried out two
                    documented playtests (with eight participants in total), and made efforts to incorporate what we
                    learned into the next prototypes.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">One
                    early insight was that by letting the on-screen marks gradually fade out, we could allow the
                    experience to be more about <i>playing around</i> than about <i>making a drawing</i>. In fact,
                    adjusting the rate of fading turned out to be key in trying to weigh up the appeal of the visual
                    output with
                    the playfulness of doing something without worrying about the results.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">As a side effect, the gradual
                    disappearance added some dimensionality and depth to the drawing.</p>
                <div class="row image">
                    
                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">

                <p class="single-project long-text">It seemed that the shared control of the pen was vital in shaping
                    the mood of the experience – without making it predictable for that matter. Depending on the
                    individuals
                    of people
                    playing, we could observe collaboration and coexistence, as well as conflict.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Hoping to make the visual feedback more exciting – or <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">juicy</a>, if you like – we went through
                    several explorations, which helped us determine how far to push the visuals before they would start
                    feeling disconnected from user action.</p>

                    The idea of enabling different modes of play came directly from one of the participants during the
                    playtest.
                    We ended up with three alternatives, varying in behavior and visual style. Shaking the maraca-like
                    device, for instance, would agitate the line or erase it, depending on the mode.</p>

                    One of the three options had the color of the line constantly alternate between blue and white,
                    which
                    boosted the dimensional illusion. Judging by the users’ engagement, this mode was the most
                    successful, striking some kind of balance between physical action, pen behavior, and the aesthetics
                    of the visuals. Tellingly, it was also the mode which had moved the furthest from a
                    conventional drawing tool.</p>
