                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    We were asked to consider an existing or near-future Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, and to
                    explore ways in which the product or environment could let itself be known to us.</p>

                    <p class="single-project long-text">How can people
                    become aware of a system’s possibilities or status – within a “heterogeneous, fluid, and often
                    invisible infrastructure”? And how do we express these possibilities without it being “intrusive,
                    annoying or ruining the atmosphere of a setting”?</p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">Rather than designing the ultimate IoT experience,
                    the point was to generate multiple variations. Additionally, we were to avoid the use of text,
                    symbols, or spoken language.</p>
                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Fieldwork</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">Our group decided to look into the opportunities and challenges of
                    smart car keys, finding inspiration in one group member’s story of how his wallet was stolen from
                    his van, which he had forgotten to lock. It happened while he was working as a deliveryman,
                    constantly
                    going in and out of his vehicle, and made him wish that the van would just know when to lock itself.
                </p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">To better understand the behaviors and habits surrounding locking
                    and unlocking the car, we spent time engaging in participant
                    observation, conducting informal interviews with family and friends, and watching people in parking
                    lots.</p>

                    <p class="single-project long-text">From our research, it
                    seemed most people had established ways of making sure they’ve locked the car, and weren’t really
                    bothered afterwards. However, there also seemed to exist a small group of people that wouldn’t stop
                    worrying – and we chose to aim our efforts at them.</p>

                                    Some desk research on existing smart car keys revealed that they all promise to make our lives
                                    easier. Learning to operate the device shown in the video, though, relies heavily on memory, without
                                    much “knowledge in the world”. If you need to consult a manual to use the key, perhaps there is room
                                    for improvement?

                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Prototyping</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Initially, our thoughts had revolved around the broad context of a connected car key,
                    along with its practical, social, and environmental aspects. Should my key notify
                    me that another family member just unlocked the car? Could the car key somehow reflect current
                    traffic conditions? A key that won’t open the car, telling me to go by bicycle instead?
                </p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Eventually, as the scope narrowed, the project turned into a kind of study of what different forms
                    of
                    device notification could feel like.</p>

                    <p class="single-project long-text">We were curious if it would be possible to mimic the feeling of
                    reassurance you might get from patting down your pocket to check if you have your phone, wallet, or
                    keys with you. What if you could know if you’ve <i>locked</i> the car, just by touching the key in your
                    pocket? Or – if the car would lock itself – could the key shift in shape or tactile sensation to
                    indicate
                    the change?</p>

                    <p class="single-project long-text">Although we briefly explored sound and

                    vibrational). By asking people – mainly
                    university students – to put the
                    prototype in their pocket, we could observe their reactions, and talk to them about the experience.

                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    The most surprising insight was how elusive the calibration of movement turned out to be, in order to make it
                    useful as notification. In testing, it was either too subtle, and not felt at all, or too strong,
                    and perceived as weird, or even unpleasant. Some described the feeling as “having a small animal” in
                    their pocket. The fact that the movement was unanticipated, rather than a direct response to
                    user action, possibly affected the experience, making the device seem to have a life of its own.</p>

                    <p class="single-project long-text">For
                    us,
                    as
                    designers, dealing with movement as notification was largely unpredictable,
                    with much fewer
                    design conventions to fall back on – at once hinting at an interesting opportunity
                    within the field.</p>
