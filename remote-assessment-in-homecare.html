                    This project was developed with <a href="http://www.innovationskane.com/">Innovation Skåne</a> (the
                    regional innovation unit) and
                    three municipal nurses working in the north of Skåne.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">Having talked to nurses involved in homecare,
                    staff from Innovation Skåne had concluded that a significant number of physicians’ visits might be
                    avoided, if
                    there was a way for patients to be
                    assessed remotely. Ideally, it would save time for nurses, spare physicians the travel, and lead to
                    sooner treatment for patients. In the long run, a better use of resources should lead to better
                    healthcare for more people.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">Our task was to prototype a service around the idea of remote
                    assessment in homecare, paying specific attention to the needs of municipal nurses.</p>
                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Background</h3>

                <p class="single-project long-text">Nurses employed by the municipality take care of patients
                    aged 75 years and older, who have three or more chronic diagnoses and suffer from periodic weakness.
                    Working
                    alone, the nurses visit their patients regularly in the patients’ homes or in retirement homes.
                </p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">Unlike their counterpart at healthcare centers or hospitals,
                    homecare nurses don’t experience
                    continuous support from co-workers, and don’t have easy access to other healthcare professionals or
                    a clinical laboratory.
                    The current healthcare agreement also restricts the flow of patient data between municipal nurses
                    and healthcare centers or hospitals, which are run by the region.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-2 col-sm-1"></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-10"><img class="img-responsive"
                            src="images/stakeholder_map_01.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-2 col-sm-1"></div>
                </div>
                <p class="caption">
                    In dialogue with staff from the innovation unit, we tried to identify the stakeholders in the system
                    around the homecare nurse. The assumed relationships between the key stakeholders allowed us to
                    recognise points of focus for the fieldwork.
                </p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">Whenever a nurse finds the need for a physician to assess the
                    patient, she (“most municipal nurses are women”) has to make a phone call, and
                    book a home
                    visit. If it’s daytime, the nurse gets in touch with a general practitioner at the local healthcare
                    center. On evenings and weekends, she contacts a doctor at Falck, a contractor, based some
                    130&nbsp;km
                    away.</p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Here, Innovation Skåne saw the opportunity for a service that could enable remote
                    assessment. They wondered: what would this system look like, and what would be the “optimal digital
                    solution” to support it? What does the physician need, to assess a patient remotely? To make it
                    possible, what tools should the nurse have at hand when visiting the patient?</p>

                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Fieldwork</h3>

                <p class="single-project long-text">To get to know the viewpoints of different stakeholders, we used qualitative methods,
                    including: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>two semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with two municipal nurses in the north of Skåne
                    </li>
                    <li>a telephone interview with a general practitioner working at a nearby primary care center</li>
                    <li>a telephone interview with a medically responsible doctor at Falck</li>
                    <li>a face-to-face interview with a digitalisation strategist and former doctor at Region Skåne who
                        is working on a
                        digital healthcare center project</li>
                    <li>a face-to-face interview with a physician on the
                        mobile doctors’ team at the local hospital</li>
                    <li>a 1½ hour long co-design workshop with three municipal nurses</li>
                </ul>


                <p class="single-project long-text">The interviewees directly involved in homecare helped us grasp the
                    habits and routines of their daily
                    work, and enabled us to visualise what goes into
                    a nurse’s home visit.</p>

                    A nurse’s journey as she visits a patient, and – suspecting
                    an infection – needs to consult a physician. The blue arrows show that travelling back and forth
                    comes with the job, while the red dots indicate “pain points”, or, in other words, opportunities for
                    change.

                    then you can start treating the patient, and the
                    doctor doesn’t need to come, and the patient doesn’t
                    need to go to the hospital.”

                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Differing views on remote assessment</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    One of the key insights we gained was that nurses
                    and physicians fundamentally differed in how they viewed the possibility of remote assessment in
                    homecare.</p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">The nurses seemed positive towards the idea, assuming it could lead
                    to patients getting faster treatment. In the nurses’ words, each of the tools enabling diagnosis
                    over distance could add “a piece of the puzzle”, which, when combined, would reveal “the whole
                    picture”. Still, while they accepted that it would mean a change in routines, the nurses did fear the increased
                    responsibility that the tools may bring along with them.</p>

                
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    The two doctors we spoke to saw no place for remote assessment in their type of practice, believing that
                    it would deprive them of the opportunity to
                    examine the patient as closely as needed. Neither one thought that any of the home visits they make today
                    could have been avoided.

                </p>
                
                <p class="single-project long-text">It appeared that, before being able to collaborate remotely, nurses
                    and physicians would actually have to be in the same place and talk to each other. We came to
                    believe
                    that the value we could bring as designers in this project was making clear why a participatory
                    approach was needed – rather than coming up with “innovative ideas” or “optimising the solution”.
                </p>
                <blockquote>“I don’t find video consultations appealing, because I can’t touch, smell, twist and turn
                    the patient. I’m left with two senses only.”<p class="quote-source">General practitioner at a
                        primary
                        care center</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>“The more we can do, the clearer the patient picture becomes, but you also have to consider
                    what we’re supposed to do with that data. How much responsibility is put on us?”
                    <p class="quote-source">Municipal nurse</p>

                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    The co-design workshop was aimed at identifying gaps surrounding the nurses’ job in the current
                    system by imagining an ideal future. One member of our group acted as workshop facilitator.</p>

                <h3 class="single-project subhead">Outcome</h3>
                <p class="single-project long-text">The first thing on our list of recommendations for Innovation Skåne
                    was a longer, deeper, and more structured participatory project, involving nurses, physicians, and
                    other key actors. In order to make a service of this complexity happen, we believed the stakeholders
                    would have to be included from an early stage – not merely to inform the outcome, but as
                    co-designers to some degree.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">
                    Along with these suggestions, we presented a prototype showing how the service <i>might</i> work.
                    Made on a smartphone, the storyboard and animation were intentionally rough, so as not to make the
                    scenario seem fixed and unchangeable, but rather function as a starting point for a discussion
                    between stakeholders.</p>

                    remote assessment, we provided our informed guesses, touching upon the role of artificial
                    intelligence, haptic interaction, augmented and virtual reality, and wearable or swallowable
                    devices.</p>
                <p class="single-project long-text">Finally, we pointed to a number of potential problems to consider,
                    which included: a loss of bodily skills among physicians, security and privacy issues when dealing
                    with sensitive data, the disruption of patient-doctor continuity, and the difficulty of translating nuanced qualities of human interaction
                    into digital technology.</p>
